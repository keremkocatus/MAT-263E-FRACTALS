Module 2: Computational Implementation

LObj1: Develop computational algorithms to generate fractal structures using iterative loops and recursive functions, and visually 
demonstrate the impact of matrix probability weights on geometric patterns.

LObj2: Analyze the efficiency of fractal geometry in engineering and technology applications, specifically evaluating its role in multi-band signal 
reception (antennas) and realistic digital terrain modeling (CGI).
